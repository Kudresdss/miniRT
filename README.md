miniRT project for 42cursus.

Currently only works on MacOS and linux systems.

This is a customizeable rendered CPU ray-traced scene written in C. It knows some basic shapes and surface properties, but not much.
Its controls are a bit outdated, I'll rewrite it in C++ for Windows compilation someday.

It uses 42cursus graphics library MiniLibX for rendering.
